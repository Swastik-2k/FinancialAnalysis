Title: Personal Finance Dashboard built on Power BI
Introduction: Managing personal finances can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with multiple sources of income and expenses. A personal finance dashboard built on Power BI can provide an easy-to-use and comprehensive solution to help individuals manage their finances. This dashboard helps individuals to gain insights into their financial status by providing an overview of their expenses, income, and investment performance. In this post, we will discuss how to build a personal finance dashboard on Power BI.

Dataset: We used a dummy dataset to create the dashboard, which includes data on monthly expenses, income, and investment returns.

Dashboard features: Our personal finance dashboard built on Power BI includes the following features:

Overview of monthly income and expenses, with a comparison to the previous month and a year ago. Breakdown of expenses by category, such as housing, transportation, and food. Analysis of investment performance, including a comparison to a benchmark index. Visualization of net worth over time, with an option to drill down into specific categories such as assets and liabilities. Forecasting of future income and expenses, with the ability to perform scenario analysis.
